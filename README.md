# 1 Year Coding Journey 🚀

This repository contains my daily coding practice as part of a
1-year journey to build strong programming and problem-solving skills,
with the long-term goal of moving into AI/ML.

## 📅 Progress
- Day 01: Python Basics (Input, Output, Variables)
- Day 02: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- Day 03: Loops and Iterative Logic

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Python fundamentals
- Input / Output
- Variables and type conversion
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Basic logical problem solving

## 🎯 Goal
- Build strong programming fundamentals
- Improve logical thinking step by step
- Stay consistent with daily practice
- Progress towards data structures, algorithms, and AI/ML concepts

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Git & GitHub

## 📌 Notes
- One folder per day to keep learning structured
- Difficulty increases gradually over time
