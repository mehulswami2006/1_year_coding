# 1 Year Coding Journey 🚀

This repository documents my daily coding practice as part of a
1-year journey to build strong programming and problem-solving skills,
with a long-term goal of moving into AI/ML.

The focus is on building fundamentals first and gradually increasing
difficulty over time.

## 📅 Progress

- Day 01: Python Basics (Input, Output, Variables)
- Day 02: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- Day 03: Loops and Iterative Logic
- Day 04: Patterns and Nested Loops
- Day 05: Number Logic with Loops

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Python fundamentals
- Input / Output
- Variables and type conversion
- Conditional statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Nested loops and patterns
- Number-based problem solving
- Logical thinking and step-by-step problem breakdown

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong programming fundamentals
- Improve logical and mathematical thinking
- Develop consistency through daily practice
- Progress towards data structures, algorithms, and AI/ML concepts
- Become interview-ready over time

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

- One folder per day
- One problem per file
- Clear and descriptive file names
- Difficulty increases gradually

This structure is intentional to make revision and long-term learning easier.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Git
- GitHub

---

## 📌 Notes

- Code prioritizes clarity over optimization
- No shortcuts or advanced libraries early on
- Focus is on understanding 'why'a solution works
